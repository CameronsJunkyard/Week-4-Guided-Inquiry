# Week-4-Guided-Inquiry
A road to hire assignment, Week 4 Guided Inquiry 

- [x] Very Easy
- [x] Easy
- [x] Medium
- [x] Hard


## Very Easy

> Write a function named min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.
---

I used the values 12 and 23 so running it should return `12`

## Easy

> Create an array of students holding their last name, first name, and age with 3 students. To validate, please log a greeting with the first name, last name, and age of the 2nd student. The output should look like "Hello, my name is John Doe and I'm 19 years old."
--- 

I used an array filled with 3 arrays each with "Student Infomation"
[firstName, lastName, age]

## Medium
> Create a program that accepts a number (1-12) as input and logs to the console that number and its corresponding month. For example: if the user enters the number 3, then it should return the month “March.” Alert the user if they enter an invalid number (e.g. less than 1 or greater than 12).
---

Since this one requires, user input pulls arguments from the terminal itself. 

`node medium.js [Month#]`

For example `node medium 12` will get you `Dec`

## Hard
> HARD: Given the information below for Tom and Jerry.
> ● Tom - height: 9in mass: 8 g
> ● Jerry - height: 10in mass: 45 g
> Compare the BMI (Body Mass Index) of Tom & Jerry using the formula below: BMI = mass / height ^2 = mass / (height * height)
> Store Tom & Jerry’s mass and height as variables. Calculate both their BMIs. Create a Boolean variable containing information about whether Tom has a higher BMI than Jerry. Print a string to the console with the variable from step 3 ( e.g. Is Tom’s BMI higher than Jerry’s? false).
---

Instead of storing the specific height and mass of Tom and Jerry into variables, I stored the result of the BMI function for both Tom and Jerry respectively.

Then I evaluated Tom's BMI to Jerry's using template literal. 


### Side Note

Why is Tom shorter then Jerry? :thinking:
Im pretty sure Tom was the Cat and Jerry was the mouse. 
Unless the mouse is literally taller than the cat.

You could of course not be talking about Cat and Mouse but I'm making an assumption.
